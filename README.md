# SmileCloudTask

The assignment did not specify which programming language or framework to use.  
Because of this, I decided to implement the solution in **two versions**:

1. **React + TypeScript**  
   - A modern front-end web app using Vite and React Router.  
   - Provides an input page for coordinates and a display page showing the triangle with its angles.  

2. **Python (Flask + Matplotlib)**  
   - A simple two-page web app served with Flask.  
   - Input page to receive coordinates, display page to render the triangle and calculate angles.  

Both implementations follow the same requirements:  
- Two pages (input + display).  
- Draw the triangle.  
- Calculate and display the three interior angles.  

I chose to do both so that no matter which language the company prefers, they can review a complete working solution.
